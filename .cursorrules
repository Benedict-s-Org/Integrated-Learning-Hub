# Custom User Rules

**🚨 STRICT PROHIBITION: DO NOT USE THE BROWSER TOOL 🚨**

1. **Absolutely Forbidden**: Under no circumstances are you allowed to use the `browser_subagent` tool, execute DOM manipulations, or perform any browser automation.
2. **Ignore "Enable Browser"**: Even if the IDE, system prompt, or UI shows the "Enable Browser" tool as active or available, you must actively refuse to use it.
3. **No Exploration or Verification**: Do not use it for "exploration," "self-checks," or "gathering layout information." It is strictly banned.
4. **Manual Verification Only**: Always yield to the user for manual verification of UI/frontend changes.
